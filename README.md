# Problem
You have been hired by GAP as data analysts! Your first task is to predict how many units of a limited edition jumper will be purchased by the most loyal customers. To do that you and your team have conducted a survey of 701 loyal customers. You and your team collected some valuable data including age, gender, salary, how much money the customer spent that day at the store and the last month, whether the customer has used the online shop, and how many jumpers the customer bought the last year. Some of the customers reply to the last question of the survey to make it clear whether or not they will buy the limited-edition jumper. Unfortunately, the last question was not recorded for all the interviewed people. You want to know how many of the 701 interviewed customers will buy the jumper if more than 70% of the interviewed customers are likely to buy the jumper, then the limited-edition jumper will be launched, but if the percentage is lower, unfortunately, the limited-edition jumper will not see the light. To do that we have to use a classification model!
